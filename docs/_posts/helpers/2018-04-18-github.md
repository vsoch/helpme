Github is the default client. To use Github, 
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/" target="_blank">
create a personal access token</a>. You can call it whatever you like (`helpme-client` in the example below).
When you generate the application, you will be redirected to a screen that shows the information,
along with a client id and client secret. You should export both of these to your environment.

```bash
export HELPME_GITHUB_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

The token will be found the first time you run the client, and cached in your `$HOME/helpme.cfg`
file. If you are interested in how this works, see the [developer](/helpme/docs-development) documentation.

## Ask for Help
The main command will be to ask for help from Github. This means we will do the following:

 - Ask you for the repository unique resource identifier, in the format owner/repo
 - Ask you to describe the issue that you are having
 - (optional) record an asciinema to show us what is going on
 - (optional) you can choose to include a whitelisted set of environment variables

Let's show the most common use case, we can either ask for help for general Github,
and then be prompted for the repository. You will be asked to enter a Github repository if you
don't provide one on the command line, and then if you want to record an asciinema.

```bash
$ helpme github
[helpme|github]
Hello Friend! I'll help you post a Github issue today.
What is the Github repository to post to? (e.g., username/reponame): 
```

or you can give the name of the repository off the bat, and skip this prompt. 
In the example below, I'm asking to post an issue to this repo, vsoch/helpme.

```bash
$ helpme github vsoch/helpme
[helpme|github]
Hello Friend! I'll help you post a Github issue today.
Please describe the issue you are having: I want to post a test issue for HelpMe Github!
Would you like to send a terminal recording?
Please enter your choice [Y/N/y/n] : Y
asciinema: recording asciicast to /tmp/helpme.5hcz3w6v.json
asciinema: press <ctrl-d> or type "exit" when you're done
Now using node v8.10.0 (npm v5.6.0)
vanessa@vanessa-ThinkPad-T460s:~/Documents/Dropbox/Code/researchapps/helpme/helpme-cli$ echo "Look at my awesome terminal! So many issues..."
Look at my awesome terminal! So many issues...
vanessa@vanessa-ThinkPad-T460s:~/Documents/Dropbox/Code/researchapps/helpme/helpme-cli$ exit
exit
asciinema: recording finished
asciinema: asciicast saved to /tmp/helpme.5hcz3w6v.json
Asciinema  If you need to run helpme again you can give
                    the path to this file with  --asciinema /tmp/helpme.5hcz3w6v.json
Environment  USER|TERM|SHELL|PATH|LD_LIBRARY_PATH|PWD|JAVA_HOME|LANG|HOME|DISPLAY
Is this list ok to share?
Please enter your choice [Y/N/y/n] : Y
https://www.github.com/vsoch/helpme/issues
[submit=>github]
```

If I need to do it again, I can supply the asciinema on the command line.

```bash
$ helpme github --asciinema /tmp/helpme.5hcz3w6v.json vsoch/helpme 
```

And [here is the issue created](https://github.com/vsoch/helpme/issues/12)!
Awesome!
